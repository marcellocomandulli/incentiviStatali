# State incentives
[See the code on CodePen](https://codepen.io/marcellocomandulli/pen/QWXaNdZ)

**This TypeScript program uses interfaces and classes to create a system for processing the startups entered, the state incentives 
available and their relative allocation, and the citizens who will participate in related proposed events.**

*In this repo you will find the index.html file that is used exclusively to execute the JavaScript app.js-file code on browsers, compiled by the transpiler from the TypeScript app.ts-file. There is also a PDF presentation explaining the TypeScript code.*

*To process and then display a TypeScript “.ts” file, you will first need to install Node.js and the TypeScript transpiler.*
### Node.js installation

Go to the [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page of node.js: 
* Choose the platform that best suits your operating system.
* Run the node.js package you downloaded.
* Verify that the installation was successful by opening the terminal (on macOS and Linux) or PowerShell (on Windows) and type the command *"node -v”*. 
* If you see the version of node.js that you downloaded from the “download” page, it means that you have successfully installed node.js on your computer.

### Installing the TypeScript transpiler
* To install the TypeScript compiler, you can run the terminal on macOS and Linux or PowerShell on Windows and type the following commands:
 *npm install -g typescript*

* When the installation is complete, typing the following command will return the actual version of TypeScript installed on your computer:   
 *tsc -v*

* It should return a string similar to this (of course, your version may be more up-to-date):                                          
*Version 5.3.3*
